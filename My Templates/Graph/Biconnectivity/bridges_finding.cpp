// Function IS_BRIDGE(a, b) is some function that will process the fact that edge (a,b) is a bridge, for example, print it.
// Note that this implementation malfunctions if the graph has multiple edges, since it ignores them. 
// Of course, multiple edges will never be a part of the answer, so IS_BRIDGE can check additionally that the reported bridge is not a multiple edge. 
// Alternatively it's possible to pass to dfs the index of the edge used to enter the vertex instead of the parent vertex (and store the indices of all vertices).
// Now, there is a back edge from vertex v or one of its descendants to one of its ancestors if and only if vertex v has a child to for which low[to] â‰¤ tin[v]. 
// If low[to] = tin[v], the back edge comes directly to v, otherwise it comes to one of the ancestors of v.
// Thus, the current edge (v,to) in the DFS tree is a bridge if and only if low[to] > tin[v].
