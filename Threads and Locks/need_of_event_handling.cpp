/* Make a Boolean global variable with default value false. Set its value to true in Thread 2 and Thread 1 will keep on checking 
its value in loop and as soon as it becomes true Thread 1 will continue with processing of data.  
But as itâ€™s a global variable shared by both of the Threads it needs synchronization with mutex. */

/* Thread will keep on acquiring the lock and release it just to check the value, therefore it will consume CPU cycles and will also make 
Thread 1 slow, because it needs to acquire same lock to update the bool flag.

So obviously we need a better mechanism to achieve this, like if somehow Thread 1 could just block by waiting for an Event to get signaled 
and another Thread could signal that Event and make Thread 1 continue. It would have save many CPU cycles and gave better performance. */
